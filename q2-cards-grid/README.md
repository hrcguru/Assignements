# Product Cards Grid

A responsive grid of product cards built with CSS Grid and semantic HTML. Features a responsive layout that adapts from a multi-column grid on desktop to a single column on mobile, with one featured card spanning the full width on wider screens.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS Grid with `auto-fit` and `minmax()` for responsive columns
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<section>`, `<article>`, `<figure>`, and other semantic elements
- **Featured Card**: First card spans full width on desktop, stacks naturally on mobile
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle hover animations for better user interaction
- **Accessible**: Meaningful alt text for images and proper heading structure
