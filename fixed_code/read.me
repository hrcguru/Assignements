Issues Fixed:

Missing Prop in UserProfile Component: In the App component, the UserProfile component was being called without passing the user object as a prop.

Incorrect Variable Reference: Inside the UserProfile component, the code was trying to access user.name and user.email directly, but it should have been props.user.name and props.user.email since the user object is passed through props.

Why it works now:

The App component passes the user object as a prop to UserProfile

The UserProfile component correctly accesses the user data through props.user

The conditional rendering {props.user && ...} ensures the user details only display when the user prop exists
